<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Nerves Injury Operative Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surgical repair</li><li>Nerve grafting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral nerves injury operative market encompasses various treatment types, primarily focusing on surgical repair and nerve grafting. Surgical repair involves direct suturing of the nerve ends after injury, aiming for optimal regeneration. Nerve grafting, on the other hand, entails using segments of healthy nerve tissue to bridge gaps created by injury. Both techniques aim to restore functional nerve connectivity, addressing impairments and improving patients' quality of life following peripheral nerve injuries.</p></p>
