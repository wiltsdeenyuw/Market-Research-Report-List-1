<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Mesh</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composite mesh market is categorized into three main types: non-absorbable mesh, absorbable mesh, and others. Non-absorbable mesh is designed for permanent implantation, providing long-term support in various surgical procedures. Absorbable mesh, on the other hand, is gradually broken down by the body, supporting healing before being fully absorbed. The 'others' category includes specialized or hybrid mesh products that may blend features of both types or possess unique properties for specific surgical applications.</p></p>
