<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tire Retreading Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Cure</li><li>Mold-Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tire retreading market primarily comprises two types: pre-cure and mold-cure retreading. Pre-cure retreading involves applying a pre-vulcanized rubber tread to a prepared tire casing, which is then cured in a separate process. In contrast, mold-cure retreading uses a mold to simultaneously shape and cure the new tread onto the tire casing, ensuring a more uniform finish. Both methods enhance tire longevity while reducing costs and environmental impact, as they allow for the reuse of tire casings.</p></p>
